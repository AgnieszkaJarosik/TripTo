#TripTo
Progressive Web App for travel planning.

## General info
The purpose of the project was to turn my first application into PWA
 by making it downloadable and installable. I wanted to get the
 basic knowledge about caching files with the Service Worker.
I also tried to learn and use libraries: Redux, React Router and Styled Components.<br />
This app communicates with my backend written in Node.js with the
 Express framework, 
which you can see here: [TripTo api](https://github.com/AgnieszkaJarosik/trip-to-api)

##Built With
- React 
- Redux
- React Router
- Styled Components

##Getting Started
Clone this repo to your desktop. 
After that go to it's root directory and run

### `npm install`

to install its dependencies. Once the dependencies are installed, you can run

### `npm start`

to start the application. You will then be able to access it at 
localhost:3000

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
